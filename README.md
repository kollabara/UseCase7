# Test Documentation for UseCase7
## Test Description
The tests for the "UseCase7" project are pivotal in guaranteeing the precision and dependability of the provided code's functionality. This suite of tests has been meticulously crafted to cover an array of scenarios and use cases, providing a thorough evaluation of the codebase's behavior. The primary aim of these tests is to validate essential functions and components while also addressing potential edge cases and input variations.

The positive test cases focus on comprehensively examining the given code across diverse scenarios, ensuring its production of the intended outcomes. Each positive test case has been meticulously designed to scrutinize specific conditions and input combinations. Furthermore, the negative test cases assess how the application handles exceptional situations and invalid inputs, thus exposing potential bugs, edge cases, and inappropriate error handling. Armed with this robust test suite, developers can confidently ensure that the application performs consistently across a range of conditions, contributing to a high-caliber software product.

## How to Run Tests Locally
Running the tests locally provides developers with real-time insights into the application's health and accuracy. Here's how you can execute the test suite on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using this command:


* git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to Project Directory: Move into the directory containing the project files using the cd command:

* cd your-repo
Run the Test Suite: Use the following command to execute the test suite using the .NET CLI:

* * dotnet test
Running the tests locally empowers developers to detect and address issues early in the development process, enhancing the overall stability and reliability of the software application.

#### Please replace placeholders like your-username and your-repo with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Incorporate this documentation into your project's README or a dedicated documentation file.
